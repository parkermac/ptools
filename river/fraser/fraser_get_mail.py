"""
Code to go into my gmail account and get the Canadian Fraser River data
they send me every day.  It only saves the attachments that have not already
been saved (nice!).

We have emails beginning 2014.02.12.

Performance: about a half second per file, or 5 min for 600 files,
but it only takes a couple of seconds in practice becase it just looks at
mails that we haven't already pulled the attachement from (using ndays).
