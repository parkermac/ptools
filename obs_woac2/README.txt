Notes from Simone 2019.10.03, for folder ptools_data/obs_woac/raw_2019_10:

Hi again Parker,

I'm attaching three things: 1) a messy Excel file of the data including calculated parameters (apologies for the messiness), 2) CSV files that are significantly more consistent in format and cleaned up than the Excel file of the data we just submitted to NCEI a few weeks ago (not yet available via their web site), and 3) the accompanying metadata to 2.  

A few details about the Excel file: columns are not necessarily in the same order.  Soon I'll concatenate all the individual cruise files and run seacarb on them to create a data product that will be publicly available and less unwieldy than this.  Apologies that I cannot give you a cleaner version right now.  Ask if you have questions about best columns to use - there are lots of redundancies.

A few details about the CSV files: I recommend using the version of each parameter in umol/kg for O2, nuts, etc.  For oxygen, the CTD O2 "adj" will be your best be bet, most likely.  We've deleted all "bad" data values from these files, though they will still be in the Excel file and flagged "4" ("2" is good, "3" is questionable).  Lemme know what other questions you have.  Will do my best to reply quickly but am out of the office next week and likely to be slower to respond until I'm back.  The metadata files that can probably answer a lot of questions in the meantime.

Simone
