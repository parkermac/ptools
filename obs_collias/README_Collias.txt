==========================================================Originally readme-1.nu in tools_data/collias_data/storet/Parker MacCready 2018.11.19The info appears to be basically the same for all 7 files.==========================================================This is disk number ONE of SEVEN and contains NINE files of oceanographic data for the following localities:        File name      Locality        -----------    ---------------------        ADM-200.NU     Admiralty Inlet        BEL-700.NU     Bellingham Channel        BLL-700.NU     Bellingham Bay        BUD-400.NU     Budd Inlet        CHK-700.NU     Chuckanut Bay        CLV-300.NU     Colvos Passage        CMM-400.NU     Commencement Bay        CRR-400.NU     Carr Inlet        CSE-400.NU     Case InletPuget Sound has been divided into eight oceanographic regions each of which have natural boundaries and have similar water characteristics.  These regions are:        100        Strait of Juan de Fuca        200        Admiralty Inlet        300        Puget Sound Basin        400        Southern Puget Sound        500        Hood Canal        600        Whidbey Basin        700        North Sound        800        San Juan Island PassagesEach of these regions is further subdivided into many small geographic locali-ties.  A six digit code has been assigned to each geographic location where water samples have been collected.  The three letters define the locality and the three numbers define the oceanographic region.The data in the body of each file conforms to the format established by the STORET system devised by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  Each group of records consists of a station header record followed by individual detail records for each date, time and depth sampled.  All samples obtained at a given geographic location are included within that set of data.  The number of geographic locations within each file varies from one to over 50.The format of the two types of records is as follows:     Station Header Record -          Column numbers          Data           --------------    ------------------------------------------             1  -   3       Geographic locality  (a three letter code)             4  -   6       Oceanographic region (a three digit code)            10  -  50       Station name (after a nearby landmark)            51  -  56       Latitude  (DDMMSS North)            61  -  67       Longitude (DDDMMSS West)     Individual Detail Records          Column numbers          Data           --------------    ------------------------------------------------             1  -   3       Geographic locality  (same as on Station Header)             4  -   6       Oceanographic region (same as on Station Header)             9  -  16       Date (YY/MM/DD)            18  -  21       Time (Usually Pacific Standard Time +8)            23  -  27       Always the word WATER            30  -  35       Depth of sample in FEET below the surface            39  -  43       Temperature in degrees Celsius            47  -  52       Salinity in parts per thousand             57  -  61       Dissolved oxygen in mg/l            65  -  70       Silicate (dissolved) in mg/l            73  -  79       Nitrite-nitrogen (dissolved) in mg/l            82  -  88       Nitrate-nitrogen (dissolved) in mg/l            91  -  97       Ortho-phosphate as phosphors (dissolved) in mg/l            99  - 106       Alkalinity as carbonate in mg/l           113  - 115       Spent Waste Liquor (Pearle-Benson Index) in mg/l           117  - 124       Ammonia (NH4)-Nitrogen (dissolved) in mg/lThe two types or records may be readily distinguished because the character in column NINE of the Station Header Record is always a blank (ASCII character 32).If data for a particular property is not present, this indicates that either this property was not measured or the values was omitted as being erroneous.A header record that can be superimposed above these data is located in the file named HEADER.The data presented in each file have been checked for accuracy and inversions in density.  Some density inversions exist and have not been eliminated be-cause the original data is consistent with adjacent stations measured at approximately the same time.These data comes from several sources as stated in the disk labeled INDEX TO OCEANOGRAPHIC DATA.This disk was prepared by Eugene E. Collias on 24 February 1992 for Evans-Hamilton, Seattle office.
